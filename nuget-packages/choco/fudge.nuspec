* Uses a Fudgefile to control required software
* Allows you to version control required software to run websites, services and applications
* Ability to run pre/post install/upgrade/downgrade/uninstall/pack scripts
* Can seperate out developer specific software which aren't needed for certain environments
* You can reinstall all packages, or just in/un/reinstall all packages
* Allows you to have mutliple nuspecs, which you can then pack one or all of with Fudge
* See details about packages in a Fudgefile - such as which ones are installed or need upgrading
* Create empty template Fudgefiles, or create them from nuspec files
* Prune the machine to remove packages not in a Fudgefile (except chocolatey/fudge obviously!)
